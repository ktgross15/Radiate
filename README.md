# Overview
Instead of doing a traditional capstone project for the Galvanize Data Science Immersive program, I did freelance work for Radiate, a mobile social networking app for music festival attendees.

I first did a churn analysis, to help them understand the characteristics of users who stopped using their app, as well as the characteristics of their more loyal users.

The second project (that I am still working on) is developing a "swiping" algorithm to optimize the users shown to a user who "swipes" to match with other Radiate users.
