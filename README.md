# Overview
Instead of doing a traditional capstone project for the Galvanize Data Science Immersive program, I did freelance work for Radiate, a mobile social networking app for music festival attendees.

I first did a churn analysis, to help them understand the characteristics of users who stopped using their app, as well as the characteristics of their more loyal users. As part of the churn analysis, I did some topic modeling (TF-IDF and NMF), to see if certain user bio topics were associated with higher churn. There did not end up being any signal there, but I've included this in a separate jupyter notebook, as it was interesting to see the key words in the top few topics.

The second project (that I am still working on) is developing a "swiping" algorithm to optimize the users shown to a user who "swipes" to match with other Radiate users. This is essentially a recommendation engine that I am using user-user Collaborative Filtering on.
